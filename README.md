Weave is distributed key-store implemented in Java/Spring and uses a custom implementation of RAFT based leader election for consensus. It is designed to be fast, accessible, and fault-tolerant.

Weave is a still a work in progress, but we intend for it to be made accessible for 3 main purposes

1) A distributed key-store for cloud based environments that can be consumed by other services
2) A go-to library for distributed Java Applications that require a consensus algorithm
3) An implementation of the RAFT Consensus algorithm for academic enrichment and the benefit of the open source community

Contact Deen Aariff at aariff.deen@gmail.com if you would like to contribute to the project.
